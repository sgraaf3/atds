=== ATDS Development Plan ===

[UNPROCESSED FUNCTIONALITIES]
The following features are required to match the advanced analytical capabilities and UI of the original ATDS software:

1. Advanced Analysis & Metrics:
   - Manual AT Line Setting: Interactive horizontal line on the chart to manually set the Anaerobic Threshold, overriding the Auto-AT.
   - Data Selection (Cropping): Ability to select a specific time range (zone) on the chart to analyze only that segment (e.g., "Analyze Selection").
   - VO2 Max Estimation: Implement algorithm to estimate VO2 Max based on HR/HRV data.
   - Live VO2 & Breath: Real-time calculation and display of metabolic and respiratory rates during live feed.
   - Age Group Comparison: Compare calculated metrics against normative data for the user's age group.
   - Firmware Version Check: Query device for "V1_5" string upon connection.

2. User Interface Overhaul ("Old but New"):
   - Settings Panel: Modal or Sidebar for configuring Units, Language, and Device preferences.
   - Toggles: Quick switches for "Filter On/Off", "Live Mode", "Show/Hide Zones".
   - Conditional Styling: UI elements that change color/style based on values (e.g., HR Zone colors, Signal Quality warnings).
   - Interactive Charting: Click-and-drag to select zones, drag AT line, Zoom controls.

3. Advanced Visualizations:
   - Multi-view Dashboard: Ability to see Linegraph and Poincare side-by-side.
   - Analyze Chart Mode: Dual-line (Filtered/Raw) view with point editing tools.

[COMPLETION STATUS]
- Core Logic: 80% (Missing advanced HRV stats like SDNN, RMSSD)
- UI/UX: 60% (Missing Settings, Interactive Zoom)
- Connectivity: 50% (Basic connection works, missing firmware checks/bonding)
- Reporting: 90% (Excel/PDF/Edit implemented)
- **Overall Status: NOT DONE.**

[PROCESSED FUNCTIONALITIES]
The following features have been implemented in the current JavaScript modules:

1. Core Analysis (ATDSAnalyzer.js):
   - Basic RR Interval Filtering & Smoothing.
   - RSA Phase Detection (Inhale/Exhale) via Inverted HR.
   - Auto AT (Anaerobic Threshold) Calculation (Formula-based).
   - Basic Heart Rate Zone generation.

2. User Interface (UIManager.js):
   - Profile Inputs (Weight, Age, Gender, BP, Fat).
   - Basic Live Charting.
   - Excel Template System (Raw, Clinical, HRV).
   - Editable Report Text (WYSIWYG).
   - Poincaré Plot Visualization.
   - Histogram Visualization.
   - Analyze Mode (Data Cleaning & Selection).
   - VO2 Max Estimation & Normative Comparison.
   - Manual AT Line (Interactive Chart Plugin).

3. Connectivity (DeviceManager.js):
   - Basic Web Serial Connection.
