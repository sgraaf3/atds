=== ATDS Development Plan ===

[UNPROCESSED FUNCTIONALITIES]
The following features are required to match the advanced analytical capabilities and UI of the original ATDS software:

1. Advanced Analysis & Metrics:
   - Advanced HRV Statistics: Implementation of SDNN and RMSSD calculations.

2. User Interface Overhaul ("Old but New"):
   - Settings Panel: Expand to include Language selection (currently supports Units/Protocol).
   - Toggles: Quick switches for "Filter On/Off", "Live Mode", "Show/Hide Zones".
   - Conditional Styling: UI elements that change color/style based on values (e.g., HR Zone colors, Signal Quality warnings).

3. Advanced Visualizations:
   - Export Options: Refine Excel export to include calculated metrics, not just raw data.

[COMPLETION STATUS]
 Core Logic: 95% (Missing SDNN/RMSSD)
 UI/UX: 85% (Settings, Zoom, Multi-view implemented. Needs polish.)
 Connectivity: 80% (Firmware check added. Bluetooth bonding pending.)
 Reporting: 95% (Excel/PDF/Edit implemented)
 **Overall Status: NEARING COMPLETION.**

[PROCESSED FUNCTIONALITIES]
The following features have been implemented in the current JavaScript modules:

1. Core Analysis (ATDSAnalyzer.js):
   - Basic RR Interval Filtering & Smoothing.
   - RSA Phase Detection (Inhale/Exhale) via Inverted HR.
   - Auto AT (Anaerobic Threshold) Calculation (Formula-based).
   - Basic Heart Rate Zone generation.

2. User Interface (UIManager.js):
   - Profile Inputs (Weight, Age, Gender, BP, Fat).
   - Basic Live Charting.
   - Excel Template System (Raw, Clinical, HRV).
   - Editable Report Text (WYSIWYG).
   - Poincaré Plot Visualization.
   - Histogram Visualization.
   - Analyze Mode (Data Cleaning & Selection).
   - VO2 Max Estimation & Normative Comparison.
   - Manual AT Line (Interactive Chart Plugin).
   - Live VO2 & Breath Analysis.
   - Age Group Comparisons.
   - Multi-view Dashboard (Line + Poincaré).
   - Data Selection (Cropping) & Zoom.
   - Settings Modal (Units, Protocol, Firmware).

3. Connectivity (DeviceManager.js):
   - Basic Web Serial Connection.
   - Firmware Version Detection ("V1_5").
